About
======
This is just a repository of random useful scripts. Some i've written my self, some by my pupils and some where just modified. Credits are given within each code. Each of them is 'not worthy' of their own repository but together they might be useful. 

Scripts
==========
## GetNanoZip.sh
Automatically downloads, installs and creates an alias within bashrc for nanozip archiving software.
## InfoSecCleaner.js
A small script for GreaseMonkey to remove ads from resources.infosec for better viewing. Too small and unprofessional to upload to UserScripts.
## RandomIPGenerator.py
Will create a bunch of IP addresses based on the rule sets of IPv4. My main use for this is with nmap. 
## SudoHoneypot.sh
A honeypot to capture sudo credentials written by a pupil of mine, Barak.
## iptables_BlockAllButFromIsrael.sh
A little script we have released prior to 7th of April 2012 to stop denial of service attacks and block connections from IPs which are not listed as Israel IP addresses. Bear in mind that this will delete all prior iptables rules.
